# 🌐 Grid of Sociopolitical Regularities (v1.0)

This is an open-source interactive tool for exploring how personal experience intersects with institutional and sociopolitical forces. Inspired by the work of Foucault, Scheurich, and Neely Fuller Jr., the project invites users to score intersections between sociopolitical **Objects** (e.g. EDUCATION, MILITARY) and **Attributes** (e.g. GENDER, CLASS), then generates a visual and narrative output of their results.
